The most frequently missing teeth in the permanent dentition, excluding the third molars, are mandibular second premolars and maxillary lateral incisors. Exclusive agenesis of both maxillary canines is an extremely rare occurrence and only a few cases have been reported. Previous studies showed that the prevalence of maxillary canine agenesis varies between 0.07 and 0.13%. In recent studies on Indian population, no cases of maxillary canine agenesis have been documented. This paper reports a case of non-syndromic bilateral agenesis of permanent maxillary canines, along with agenesis of both mandibular central incisors in a healthy 13-year-old Indian female patient; and a brief literature review on prevalence, etiology and treatment modalities of the condition.

       "\"\\nBelow are the two case descriptions (with the same details as before) and the set of questions to be answered.\\n\\n---\\nCase A:\\nA 4.5-year-old boy was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences with the chief complaint of swelling and mild pain in the posterior right mandibular area. An informed signed consent was obtained from the parent of the patient. The familial and medical histories were not contributory, and no evidence of facial trauma was reported.\\n On extra oral examination, there was mild swelling of the right lower jaw leading to mild facial asymmetry. The swelling was bony hard in consistency.\\n An intraoral examination revealed buccal and lingual cortical expansion. The overlying mucosa was normal. A vitality test with an electrical pulp tester yielded a positive reaction for the deciduous mandibular second molar. There was no functional difficulty with speech, swallowing, and breathing.\\n On panoramic radiography, there was a well-defined capsulated non-homogenized radiopaque mass related to the apical region of the right deciduous mandibular second molar ( figure 1 ). Another considerable situation was that the roots of the right first unerupted molar were developed in comparison with the opposite side and had unusual radiolucency with them.\\n Panoramic view of the lesion shows a well-defined radiopaque mass at the apical region of the right deciduous mandibular second molar. Notice the radiolucent rim around the lesion and more developed roots of the right first unerupted molar.\\n On the basis of the clinical and radiographic features, the differential diagnosis of this lesion included odontoma, cementoblastoma, and osteoblastoma. Considering the radiographic features based on the attachment to the tooth root, we ruled out osteoblastoma. However, microscopic examination was necessary to differentiate between odontoma and cementoblastoma. Surgical enucleation of the lesion, including the removal of the involved teeth, was planned and executed under general anesthesia.\\n The tumor mass was embedded in the root of the deciduous mandibular second molar tooth and had an irregular surface with a maximum dimension of 1.6 cm.\\n Histopathologic examination revealed sheets of a cementum-like material entrapped within the vascular connective tissue stroma ( figure 2a ).\\nThe intervening connective tissue stroma was loose and vascular. Prominent reversal lines were seen within the sheets of the cementum-like material. Numerous large cementoblasts were evident\\naround the calcified materials ( figure 2b ). Based on these finding and considering the attachment of the lesion to the tooth root, we confirmed the diagnosis of cementoblastoma.\\n Microscopic features of the tumor are depicted here, showing a) sheets and trabeculae of a cementum-like material with a loose vascular stroma (H & E staining, ×100) and b) prominent reversal lines (black arrow) and numerous large cementoblasts (red arrows) around the cementum-like material (H & E staining, ×400).\\n Regular post-surgical follow-ups revealed a new lesion at age 5.5 with mild swelling. On panoramic evaluation, there were 2 circular homogenized well-defined and capsulated\\nradiopaque masses related to both roots of the erupted first mandibular molar ( figure 3a ). Further surgery was done to remove the lesion and the associated tooth. The lesion presented the previous diagnosis and cementoblastoma was reported. a) Panoramic view shows 2 radiopaque masses related to both roots of the mandibular first erupted molar. Notice the radiolucent rim around the lesion. b) Panoramic view shows the unusual recurrence of the lesion, a circular radiopaque mass in the edentulous region of the extracted mandibular first molar. Notice the radiolucent rim around the lesion.\\n At age 8 years, the patient was referred to the abovementioned department with a complaint of swelling at the previously mentioned location.\\n In the panoramic view, there was a circular capsulated homogenized radiopaque mass in the edentulous region of the extracted mandibular first molar ( figure 3b ). Local wide excision was performed under general anesthesia, and the recurrent lesion was harvested. Similar to the previous diagnosis, the lesion presented a benign cementoblastoma.\\n Given the unusual recurrences of the lesion after local wide lesion excision, we recommended a close follow-up of the patient. At 3 follow-ups of the patient at 3, 6, and 9 months after the last surgery, there was no evidence of recurrence fortunately.\\n\\n\\nCase B:\\nAn 8-year-old healthy male child reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology of our institute with a chief complaint of pain and mild swelling in the left body of the mandible which had been increasing in size for the past 2 months. On clinical examination, no extraoral swelling was present in lower one-third of the face. Mild intraoral swelling with obliteration of the vestibular space was associated with deciduous mandibular left first molar. The swelling was diffuse and hard in consistency, with expansion of buccal cortex. Tenderness on palpation was noticed. Overlying mucosa was normal with no ulceration or purulent discharge. No carious teeth were seen in the region. Radiological examination using cone beam computed tomography revealed a localized mixed radio-opaque–radiolucent lesion in the buccal aspect extending from the distal aspect of 32 to the mesial aspect of developing 34 [Figure  1a  and  1b ]. The lesion was surrounded by a thin, uniform radiolucent line [ Figure 2 ]. It was involving the periapices of 74 and was in continuity with the roots of the same [ Figure 3 ]. It extended inferiorly up to the middle third level of the coronal portion of the developing 33. The approximate maximum dimensions of the lesion were 11.9 mm × 13.8 mm × 16 mm [ Figure 4 ]. Considering the clinical and radiographical findings, differential diagnosis of the lesion included odontogenic tumor, fibro-osseous lesion or hypercementosis. An excisional biopsy was performed for final diagnosis. Cone beam computed tomography showing localized mixed radio-opaque–radiolucent lesion in the buccal aspect extending from the distal aspect of 32 to the mesial aspect of developing 34. (a) Axial view (b) Panoramic view Cone beam computed tomography showing lesion surrounded by a peripheral radiolucency (yellow arrows) Cone beam computed tomography radio-opacity involving the periapices of 74 and is in continuity with the roots of the same (yellow arrows) Cone beam computed tomography approximate maximum dimensions of the lesion (11.9 mm × 13.8 mm) The gross specimen included multiple bits of hard tissues and deciduous mandibular first molar. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections showed sheets of cementum-like tissue with prominent reversal lines [ Figure 5 ]. Areas of fibrovascular connective tissue interspersed between cementum like masses [ Figure 6 ]. At the periphery of the lesion, radiating columns of cellular unmineralized cementoid tissue was evident [ Figure 7 ]. Multinucleated giant cells and plump cementoblasts were also seen [ Figure 8 ]. Prominent and numerous basophilic reversal lines were appreciable [ Figure 9 ]. On basis of clinical, radiological and histopathological correlation, a diagnosis of cementoblastoma was given. The patient is on follow up since last 6 months and is free of disease. Photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained decalcified sections show sheets of cementum like tissue with prominent reversal lines (H&E stain, ×4) Photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained decalcified sections show areas of fibrovascular connective tissue interspersed between cementum like masses (H&E stain, ×10) Photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained decalcified sections show radiating columns of cellular unmineralized cementoid tissue at the periphery of the lesion (H&E stain, ×10) Photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained decalcified sections show multinucleated giant cells and plump cementoblasts (H&E stain, ×40) Photomicrograph of hematoxylin and eosin stained decalcified sections show prominent and numerous basophilic reversal lines (H&E stain, ×40)\\n\\nReason for Citation, Possible Similarities and Explanation:\\nReason for Citation: To provide context regarding the rare occurrence of cementoblastomas in primary dentition.  \\nPossible Similarities: Both cases involve young male patients with cementoblastomas affecting primary molars.  \\nExplanation: The cited paper is referenced to highlight the clinical presentation and rarity of cementoblastomas in deciduous teeth, drawing parallels with the current report's findings in an 8-year-old boy. It supports the discussion on differential diagnosis and management by comparing with another unusual pediatric case where both deciduous and permanent teeth were involved.  \\nConfidence: Medium\\n\\nQuestions:\\nLevel 1 – Broad Context (Anatomy and Modality):\\n1. Do both Case A and Case B involve lesions in the mandibular region?\\n2. Are both cases assessed using radiographic imaging modalities (panoramic radiography in Case A and cone beam CT in Case B)?\\n\\nLevel 2 – General Diagnostic Category:\\n3. Do both cases present with cementoblastomas as the final diagnostic outcome?\\n4. Are both patients pediatric males presenting with lesions involving primary (deciduous) molar regions?\\n5. Considering the overall clinical findings, do both cases suggest a benign osseous neoplasm rather than an aggressive or malignant process?\\n\\nLevel 3 – Specific Imaging Findings and Features:\\n6. Do both cases demonstrate a well-defined radiopaque mass with a peripheral radiolucent rim on imaging studies?\\n7. In both cases, is there evidence of cortical expansion (buccal and/or lingual) associated with the lesion?\\n8. Are reversal lines and cementum-like tissue features identified histopathologically in both cases?\\n9. Do both cases show continuity or attachment of the lesion to the root or periapical region of an associated tooth?\\n10. Is the lesion size or recurrence pattern in Case A (with recurrences noted) in contrast to the singular excised lesion in Case B?\\n11. Are there any differences in the clinical presentation, such as pain and tenderness (present in Case B versus minimal pain in Case A)?\\n12. Does the involvement of both deciduous and permanent teeth in Case A differ in management or prognosis from the lesion in the deciduous tooth region in Case B?\\n---\\n\\nProvide your answers now:\\n\""

    "1. **Refer to Both Cases**  \n",
    "   - You will be given the same case details for Case A, Case B, Reason for Citation, along with the full list of questions.\n",
    "   - Answer each question by explicitly referencing the relevant details from Case A and Case B that support your conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure of Answers**  \n",
    "   - For yes/no questions, begin your response with a clear “Yes” or “No,” then provide a brief rationale.\n",
    "   - For open-ended or more detailed comparative questions, give a concise yet clinically thorough answer.\n",
    "   - If you need to highlight differences in imaging findings, symptoms, or etiologies, do so clearly and directly.\n",
    "   - Split each answer to 'In case A, ...' and 'In case B, ...'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clinical Depth & Relevance**  \n",
    "   - Focus on the clinical significance of each answer, referencing imaging features, pathophysiology, or typical clinical presentation.\n",
    "   - Avoid tangential or purely theoretical discussion; make sure each answer directly relates to the question and helps differentiate or confirm diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accuracy & Clarity**  \n",
    "   - Base your answers on standard radiological and clinical knowledge, ensuring that any assertions are consistent with typical findings and established practice.\n",
    "   - If you must make an assumption (e.g., missing data), state it explicitly and provide your best inference based on standard clinical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Format**  \n",
    "   - Number your answers to match the questions.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, the patient was diagnosed with choroidal osteoma that later developed secondary choroidal neovascularization, confirmed by OCTA and other imaging modalities.  \n",
      " • In case B, the clinical and imaging findings (FFA, OCT, and B-scan USG) established the diagnosis of choroidal osteoma complicated by secondary CNV.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, B-scan ultrasonography revealed a dense echogenic (hyperechoic) plaque with acoustic shadowing, which is typical for choroidal osteoma.  \n",
      " • In case B, B-scan USG similarly demonstrated a hyperechoic choroidal lesion causing acoustic shadowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, intravitreal ranibizumab was administered following the detection of CNV, leading to improvement in OCT findings and BCVA.  \n",
      " • In case B, ranibizumab injections were used as the primary treatment for CNV with subsequent improvement in visual acuity and subretinal fluid regression.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, OCT imaging after ranibizumab therapy showed regression of the subretinal fluid associated with the CNV.  \n",
      " • In case B, OCT imaging similarly indicated resolution of subretinal fluid following anti-VEGF treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, over the years the osteoma showed growth along its margins, with documented decalcification on the inferior margin and associated choroidal atrophy.  \n",
      " • In case B, there is no mention of lesion growth or decalcification; the description focuses on a well-defined, slightly raised lesion without these additional degenerative features.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, FFA showed an early hyperfluorescent choroidal filling pattern with late diffuse staining though CNV was not pronounced on FFA compared to OCTA findings.  \n",
      " • In case B, FFA revealed early hyperfluorescence that increased in later stages, typical of choroidal osteoma with CNV, reflecting a similar overall angiographic pattern despite minor differences in the visibility of CNV.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. No.  \n",
      " • In case A, the lesion is described as peripapillary and involving the macula, indicating a broader area including the optic disc margin.  \n",
      " • In case B, the lesion is predominantly located at the macula, with no involvement of the peripapillary region noted.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, OCT and OCTA provided more detailed insights including detection of subretinal neovascularization with choriocapillaris atrophy, layered analysis (outer retinal and choriocapillaris layers), and changes in CNV density and range over time.  \n",
      " • In case B, imaging details are based on spectral domain OCT that demonstrated subretinal fluid; however, no layered OCTA details or choriocapillaris atrophy were described.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Yes.  \n",
      " • In case A, following three intravitreal ranibizumab injections, the patient’s BCVA improved from 5/20 to 18/20 with OCT showing regression of subretinal fluid, and long-term stability was noted over a 1-year follow-up.  \n",
      " • In case B, after a series of injections and additional treatment when needed, the patient’s visual acuity improved from 0.16 (and later 0.4 at a decline) to 0.8, with OCT confirming regression of subretinal fluid and stability over a 2-year period.\n"

       " 'citing_abstract': 'Background Choroidal osteoma is a benign intraocular tumor that can increase risk of developing choroidal neovascularization. The visual prognosis is influenced by the tumor location, decalcification status, overlying RPE atrophy, presence of choroidal neovascularization, persistence of subretinal fluid and occurrence of subretinal hemorrhages. Case presentation The authors present a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with choroidal osteoma of the right eye. Her best corrected visual acuity was 12/20 but decreased to 5/20 due to secondary choroidal neovascularization after 8\\u2009years follow up. Fundus examination revealed an enlarged choroidal osteoma in most margins at posterior pole with schistose hemorrhage beside macula. Optical coherence tomography angiography revealed unique features in the vascular changes of choroidal neovascularization in choroidal osteoma in the outer retinal layer and choroid capillary layers, and subretinal neovascularization. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography showed there was hypo-fluorescence at the peripapillary with faint hyper-fluorescence at the macular, corresponding to the location on the fundus photograph. The patient received 3 injections of intravitreal ranibizumab. After 1\\u2009year follow up, her visual acuity of the right eye was 18/20 and the CNV had regressed. Conclusions We present the findings and treatment of a case of choroidal osteoma with secondary choroidal neovascularization. Optical coherence tomography angiography combined with FFA and ICGA is used to analysis the characteristics of secondary choroidal neovascularization. Optical coherence tomography angiography can reveal some unique characteristics in the vascular changes compared to fundus fluorescein angiography.',\n",
       " 'citation_paragraphs': ['There is no standard of treatment for choroidal osteomas in addition to observing, but therapies are directed for complications arising from CNV and subretinal fluid. There are some reports describe the clinical and diagnostic features of this tumor, some of them treat related CNV with photodynamic therapy or/and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) [ 9 ,  10 ]. Some studies showed PDT had achieved success not only in the management of CNV secondary to choroidal osteoma but also preventing tumor growth toward the foveola [ 10 ,  11 ]. However, reperfusion following photodynamic therapy might lead to CNV formation and tumor decalcification [ 11 ,  12 ]. Furthermore, PDT may require more than once treatment and final visual acuity may decline [ 13 ]. In addition, thermal laser photocoagulation and transpupillary thermotherapy may have certain efficacy in cases of CNV secondary to choroidal osteoma while increasing retinal damage [ 5 ,  14 ,  15 ].',\n",
       "  'Another method of controlling CNV growth is intravitreal anti-VEGF. Our case was treated by anti-VEGF and stable for now, in spite of keeping indispensable monitoring. It is reported bevacizumab and ranibizumab have positive outcomes in both anatomy and visual acuity [ 9 ,  16 ]. The rapid regression of CNV secondary to CO may attributed to enhanced passage of the ranibizumab through the thinned and degenerated RPE and Bruch’s membrane to the subretinal area, thus increasing the drug’s efficacy [ 16 ].'],\n",

Early and late hyperfluorescence related with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was detected in the right eye on fundus fluorescein angiography. B-scan ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic choroidal lesion with acoustic shadowing. The lesion was diagnosed as choroidal osteoma. The patient received 3 injections of intravitreal ranibizumab. After 4 months, the visual acuity of the right eye was 0.9 and the CNV had regressed. Follow-up at about 7 months revealed reduced visual acuity in the right eye with an increase in subretinal fluid.
