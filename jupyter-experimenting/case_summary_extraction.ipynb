The patient described noticing a bulge located in her left lower quadrant when symptomatic that would subsequently disappear after having a bowel movement. She often needed to massage the area and change position to facilitate a bowel movement. Upon further questioning, the patient denied use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiates or other medications known to cause constipation. She denied any personal or family history of colon cancer. Her physical exam, including a digital rectal exam, was unremarkable.\\xa0Laboratory tests including hemoglobin and hematocrit were also within normal range. A colonoscopy was performed which revealed a large broad-based 6 cm pedunculated polypoid lesion at the descending colon that appeared to be causing a ball-valve type intermittent colonic obstruction (Figure  1 ). Grossly, the mass had normal overlying mucosa with evidence of slight erosions at the tip. Using biopsy forceps, the polypoid lesion was investigated and demonstrated a positive pillow sign. An endoloop device was then deployed at the stalk and the entire mass was endoscopically resected with snare cautery en-bloc and removed from the colon\\xa0using a net retrieval device\\xa0(Figure  2 ). Upon inspection of the snare cautery site, the endoloop was noted to have been inadvertently cut and a small, colonic bowel wall defect was noted.

Other symptoms included anal pain and rectal bleeding. During the physical examination, the prolapsed mass was spontaneously reduced through the rectum. The mass was initially diagnosed as a rectal prolapse and the patient was transferred to the Department of General Surgery, Buyukcekmece State Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey) in June 2012. During the physical examination, the mass was forced out from the anal canal while the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver under light sedation. The mass (size, 10×8 cm) had a shiny surface and hyperemia was detected during the physical inspection ( Fig. 1 ). A smooth-surfaced soft tissue with a pedicle (diameter, 3 cm) was detected on palpation. The mass was reduced manually by gentally pushing it through the anus. The routine laboratory examination results were normal and no abnormalities were noted in the patient’s background or family history. A colonoscopy was performed, and at the 35th cm of the anal canal, a mobile, shiny, hyperemic, smooth-surfaced, giant polyp (size, 10×8×7.5 cm), which was covered by a mucosa and a pedicle (diameter, 3 cm) was occluding almost all of the lumen ( Fig. 2 ). At the sigmoid colon, an 8×6-cm fat-density lesion (representing the lipoma) was observed via abdominal computed tomography (CT;  Fig. 3 ). An endoscopic polypectomy was attempted, however, it was unsuccessful due to the size of the lesion measuring ~10 cm in its maximum diameter making it difficult to manipulate the lesion. As a result, an external excision was scheduled. Under light sedation the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver and the mass was forced out from the anal canal. In order to perform an easy removal of the mass from the anus, the pedicle at the exit of the anal canal was tied and the patient’s depth of anesthesia was strengthened. The mass was pulled out, and the distal end of the pedicle was tied and excised. The resected specimen underwent histopathological examination ( Fig. 4 ), which revealed the mass to be a submucosal lipoma with a normal mucosa. The patient was discharged on the first postoperative day on which he did not experience any complications. The colonoscopy, which was performed two weeks later, was considered to be normal.'}"

She was in good health with no history of systemic disease or syndrome. Intraoral examination revealed a class I molar relationship with a centered dental midline and increased anterior overbite. A diastema of 2\\u2009mm between 22 and 23 was observed. Clinical examination of the maxillary teeth revealed a small canine showing signs of attrition on the right side with no mobility ( Figure 1 ). There was a small caries on the distal aspect of the tooth.

A panoramic radiograph was taken to detect the presence and the location of the permanent canine and to check for any other anomalies. The radiograph showed that the right permanent canine was missing and the erupted canine was deciduous with its small root, short crown size, and thin enamel structure. The deciduous canine was persisting with root resorption grade 1 [ 12 ] and all third molar germs were also missing ( Figure 2 ). The clinical history that ruled out any possibility of the permanent canine had been extracted or the patient had undergone dental trauma. There was no relevant family history for this condition. No other tooth anomalies were observed. However an irregularly shaped radiopacity in the left third molar region of the mandible was remarkable ( Figure 2 ). The lesion was diagnosed as idiopathic osteosclerosis on periapical view ( Figure 3 ). The patient was referred to the Department of Restorative Dentistry for the restoration of the decayed tooth.'],\n",
       " [\"A 35-year-old female presented with multiple asymptomatic nodules which started over face and gradually increased in size and number since age of 5 years [ Figure 1a ]. Few nodules appeared over scalp 5 years back and gradually increased in size [ Figure 1b ]. Her son, younger and elder sister, father, father's sister, and grandmother had history of similar lesions [Figure  1c  &  d  and  2 ]. On examination, multiple, asymptomatic, skin-colored, firm, papulonodular lesions measuring from 2 to 8 mm with smooth surface were present on central part of face [ Figure 1a ]. Scalp showed pinkish, firm, dome-shaped nodules with smooth surface measuring about 1 to 3 cm [ Figure 1b ]. No abnormality was detected on systemic examination. Routine blood and urine examination were normal. Histopathological examination of punch biopsy sample from lesion over face showed basaloid inclusions with multiple immature hair follicles and abundant stroma, thus confirming the diagnosis of trichoepithelioma [ Figure 3a ]. The lesions over scalp showed well-circumscribed epithelial neoplasm in mid and deep dermis comprising of basaloid cells arranged in closely crowded reticulated pattern giving a jigsaw puzzle appearance. Within these nodules, several scattered ductal structures lined by eosinophilic cuticle and pink colloidal intracytoplasmic bodies were present. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of cylindroma [ Figure 3b ]. Based on clinical and histopathological features, diagnosis of BSS was made. As the only concern of patient was regarding cosmetic appearance, she was referred to plastic surgeon for excision of nodular lesions.

There was a history of similar lesions in her family including her mother, aunt, cousins, grandfather, and her elder child [ Figure 1 ]. Family pedigree chart showing affected members in four successive generations On examination, multiple, rounded, smooth surfaced, firm, non-tender, skin colored to reddish papules and nodules of varying sizes were seen on scalp and face [ Figure 2 ]. Lesion was also extending to nose, arms, and legs [ Figure 3 ]. Examination of mucosa, nails, and hair showed no abnormalities. All the laboratory investigations were within the normal range. Computed tomography brain showed multiple lobulated masses over scalp and face, which could represent neoplastic or inflammatory pathology [ Figure 4 ]. Biopsy was suggested for further evaluation. Gene mapping was done. The susceptibility locus has been mapped to chromosome 16q12-q13. Clinical photograph showing multiple papulonodular lesions on scalp and face Patient showing multiple papulonodular lesions on leg Computed tomography brain showing multiple lobulated masses over scalp and face Fine needle aspiration was performed and smears were stained with May-Grünwald stain (MGG). The most distinctive feature in the aspirated material was the homogenous hyaline globules stained purple with MGG. These globules were surrounded by cohesive benign epithelial cells with dark uniform nuclei. The background was clean and no mitosis was noticed. Surgical excision along with the skin grafting was performed to improve the facial appearance of the patient. Specimen was submitted in the histopathology section. On gross examination, the lesion was nodular with irregular surface [ Figure 5 ]. Cut surface was solid and homogenously grey white. Gross photograph showing grayish brown growth with an irregular nodular surface Histopathologically, the lesion consisted of well-circumscribed islands of epithelial cells surrounded by a dense membrane material, and focally containing hyaline globules.

       " [\"A 62-year-old healthy man was transferred to our hospital. He had uneventful phacoemulsification and the posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the right eye in a private clinic 3 months ago. Review on the first postoperative day, and follow-up was unremarkable and no procedure such as suture removal or YAG capsulotomy was done. His medical history was not significant, and a review of systems failed to indicate any potential signs or symptoms of chronic or malignant disease. He experienced sudden ocular pain and the deterioration of visual acuity the day before his visit. At a private clinic, he received intravitreal vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 ml) and amikacin (0.4 mg/0.1 ml) but. the condition became worse. He was transferred to our hospital with a sample of vitreous humor obtained during the intravitreal injection. At the time of transfer, examination revealed visual acuity of hand motion in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 28 mmHg in the right eye and 14 mmHg in the left eye. The right eye was intensely injected; 4+ cells in the anterior chamber, 2 mm hypopyon, mid dilated-fixed pupil, grade 4 vitreous opacity and a very weak red reflex degree were noted on examination ( Fig. 1A ). B-scan ultrasonography showed floating materials in vitreous. The WBC count was 14100/mm 3 , and C-reactive protein (CRP) value was positive at 92.2 mg/dl. The chest X-ray and ultrasound scan of abdomen and heart showed no abnormalities. On that day, we aspirated some vitreous humor and sent it to the laboratory for Gram's staining. In the Gram's staining, gram-negative bacilli were detected. We performed pars plana vitrectomy using 175 µg/ml ceftazidime in the irrigating solution, 3  IOL explantation, removal of the capsular bag and intravitreal ceftazidime (2.25 mg/0.1 ml) injection. During the vitrectomy, we saw severe cyclic membrane and thick exudative membrane that covered the entire retina. After delicate vitrectomy like shaving, we could see the disc and major vessel arcade faintly. The vitreous humor obtained during vitrectomy and the IOL were sent to the laboratory for smear and culture test. The day after the vitrectomy, severe stromal edema in cornea and mild fibrous membrane at the pupil were detected. The patient received ceftazidime 1 g (2 times/day) and tobramycin 80 mg (2 times/day) intravenously. He was treated with fortified ceftazidime (50 mg/ml) and levofloxacin eyedrops every 30 minutes and oral prednisolone 45 mg daily. Two days postoperatively, in the culture of aspirated vitreous during vitrectomy and the vitreous humor from the private clinic, the same bacteria  Sphingomonas paucimobilis  was isolated ( Fig. 2  and  3 ). Disk susceptibility on Mueller-Hintom agar demonstrated susceptibility to ampicillin, aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem, and peperacillin and resistance to tobramycin. Two weeks postoperatively, the IOP in the right eye was 12 mmHg. 1+ cells in the anterior chamber, the reduction of the exudates in the peripheral retina, and grade 1 vitreous opacity were detected. Three months postoperatively, the best corrected visual acuity improved to 20/300. No cells were found in the anterior chamber or vitreous cavity. A mild pale color of optic disc and macular degeneration like pigmentary changes were detected ( Fig. 1B ).\",\n",
       "  'A 30-year-old-man presented with a visual acuity (VA) of 6/120 and severe ocular pain following a penetrating left eye injury. Slit-lamp examination revealed perforation of the temporal cornea and iris; in the anterior chamber, there was hypopyon and a fibrinous membrane covering the pupil. Ultrasonography showed dense vitreous infiltration while a computerized tomography (CT) orbital scan confirmed the presence of a metallic IOFB in the vitreous cavity ( Figure 1 ). Ophthalmic and systemic treatment were initiated (vancomycin drops and amikacin drops every 2 hours, atropine 1% twice daily, intravenous vancomycin 1\\u2009g three times daily, and intravenous amikacin 750\\u2009mg twice daily). The IOFB was removed with a pars-plana vitrectomy combined with phacoemulsification and undiluted vitreous specimens were sent for laboratory testing ( Figure 2 ). An oxidase positive, Gram-negative aerobic bacterium with yellow pigmented colonies was isolated.  Sphingomonas paucimobilis  was identified and found to be sensitive to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and ceftazidime. Despite the initially excellent response (VA: 6/9) six months postoperatively, eight months postoperatively, a stage 3 macular hole was observed as well as severe VA deterioration. A second vitrectomy was performed, but VA remained low over the following 24 months despite macular hole closure.'],\n",

During the physical examination, the prolapsed mass was spontaneously reduced through the rectum. The mass was initially diagnosed as a rectal prolapse and the patient was transferred to the Department of General Surgery, Buyukcekmece State Hospital (Istanbul, Turkey) in June 2012. During the physical examination, the mass was forced out from the anal canal while the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver under light sedation. The mass (size, 10×8 cm) had a shiny surface and hyperemia was detected during the physical inspection ( Fig. 1 ). A smooth-surfaced soft tissue with a pedicle (diameter, 3 cm) was detected on palpation. The mass was reduced manually by gentally pushing it through the anus. The routine laboratory examination results were normal and no abnormalities were noted in the patient’s background or family history. A colonoscopy was performed, and at the 35th cm of the anal canal, a mobile, shiny, hyperemic, smooth-surfaced, giant polyp (size, 10×8×7.5 cm), which was covered by a mucosa and a pedicle (diameter, 3 cm) was occluding almost all of the lumen ( Fig. 2 ). At the sigmoid colon, an 8×6-cm fat-density lesion (representing the lipoma) was observed via abdominal computed tomography (CT;  Fig. 3 ). An endoscopic polypectomy was attempted, however, it was unsuccessful due to the size of the lesion measuring ~10 cm in its maximum diameter making it difficult to manipulate the lesion. As a result, an external excision was scheduled. Under light sedation the patient performed the Valsalva maneuver and the mass was forced out from the anal canal. In order to perform an easy removal of the mass from the anus, the pedicle at the exit of the anal canal was tied and the patient’s depth of anesthesia was strengthened. The mass was pulled out, and the distal end of the pedicle was tied and excised. The resected specimen underwent histopathological examination ( Fig. 4 ), which revealed the mass to be a submucosal lipoma with a normal mucosa. The patient was discharged on the first postoperative day on which he did not experience any complications. The colonoscopy, which was performed two weeks later, was considered to be normal.'],\n",

       " [\"A 3-year-old girl was admitted to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Pontific Catholic University of Minas Gerais, with brown discoloration and advanced wear in the primary teeth. She was in good health, and her medical history was non-contributory. The intraoral exam showed pulp exposure and the presence of periapical fistulae. The patient's radiographs exhibited teeth with shortened and worn crowns, thin roots with constriction in the cervical region, and total or partial obliteration of the pulp chamber and the root canals of the previous deciduous teeth. The clinical and radiographic images of the patient, in association with her family's medical history, supported the diagnosis of dentinogenesis imperfecta type II, as described by Shields et al., 1  with a pedigree covering 3 generations ( Fig. 1 ). The treatment plan set up for this patient had the aim of preserving the tooth structures because of their susceptibility to accentuated wear of the tooth crowns. At 7 years of age, the patient returned to the clinic. An intraoral exam showed the beginning of the eruption of the permanent first molars, an early loss of deciduous teeth, an intraoral abscess, and deciduous teeth with exposed dentin. To protect the permanent first molars from early wear, a photopolymerizable composite resin (Command Universal, Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA, USA) was added to the occlusal surface, which also allowed an increase in the vertical dimension of the lost occlusion due to the wear of the deciduous molars. Some months later, temporary stainless steel crowns were cemented to the 4 permanent first molars to protect the integrity of the natural crowns ( Fig. 2 ). Aimed at obtaining occlusal balance without overloading these molars, photopolymerizable composite resin (Command Universal and Herculite XR, Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA, USA) was added to the mandibular deciduous molars. Under the supervision of an orthodontist, the decision was made to extract a number of deciduous teeth. Upon treatment completion, a new stage of follow-up began until the complete eruption of the maxillary and mandibular incisors. At 9 years of age, a complete crown was manufactured using another type of photopolymerizable composite resin (Multifill and Durafill, Heraeus Kulzer, South Bend, IN, USA), by a direct method, for the maxillary central and lateral incisors and the mandibular central incisors. At the beginning of the eruption of the permanent pre-molars, an acrylic retainer with a bite plane was inserted to survey the bite and free up space for the pre-molars to erupt. After a year, the use of the Hawley retainer was suspended, and the maxillary and mandibular pre-molars were again covered by a complete crown manufactured using photopolymerizable composite resin. At the same time, the temporary stainless steel crowns were removed from the permanent first molars to create a more physiological space for them. A new stage of observation began. At 12 years of age, the patient returned for a follow-up visit. Crowns for the first and second molars were manufactured using photopolymerizable composite resin in the same manner as those manufactured for the incisors and pre-molars. Later, the permanent canines were also covered with resin. Another observation period started. At 18 years of age, it was necessary to extract the patient's maxillary third molars and the right mandibular third molar, as these were unerupted and impacted. The left mandibular third molar was not extracted, as it was well-positioned in the dental arch. After 17 years of follow-up, at 20 years of age, the patient underwent her final evaluation. All the permanent teeth were covered with photopolymerizable resin and were appropriately positioned ( Fig. 3 ). No periodontal alterations were found, and the esthetics were adequate. The third molars had already been extracted. The extracted third molars were sent for analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using Stereoscan 440 (Leica Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) with a magnification of up to ×1000, and were compared with normal teeth. The SEM images showed changes in both the enamel and the dentin of the teeth affected by dentinogenesis imperfecta. While the dentin and the enamel of a normal tooth appear as a compact mass of hydroxyapatite crystals forming prisms of the enamel in an organized and guided manner ( Fig. 4A ), the enamel structure of the teeth affected by dentinogenesis imperfecta showed changes throughout the enamel, with the absence of parallelism in the prismatic enamel crystals and variation in crystalline size ( Fig. 4B ). With respect to the microstructure of the dentin, we observed, in the SEM images, differences in the size, diameter, quantity, and direction of the dentin tubules ( Fig. 4C ). The SEM images of the dentin structure of the affected teeth showed obliteration and a reduction of the quantity of the dentin tubules, with the presence of many atubular areas ( Fig. 4D ).\",\n",

There was decrease in lower facial height due to severe attrition to the level of gingiva. Intraorally, generalized brownish discoloration of teeth with loss of enamel was seen [ Figure 1 ]. Dental caries cannot develop in these cases owing to the absence of dentinal tubules and inability of caries to develop on a surface where enamel is rapidly being lost due to abrasion and fracture. The case presented here confirms this with the absence of carious lesions. Intraoral view with brownish discoloration and severe attrition Panoramic study showed narrow pulp chamber with severe coronal attrition and multiple periapical radiolucencies [ Figure 2 ]. Unstained ground section with photomicrography showed irregular dentinal tubules with increased hypomineralized interglobular dentin and obliterated pulp chamber [Figures  3 – 5 ]. Panoramic Radiograph showing obliterated pulp chambers Photomicrograph showing irregular dentinal tubules Photomicrograph showing increased interglobular dentin Photomicrograph showing obliterated pulp chamber']]"
